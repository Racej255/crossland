  ### The Rise of House Crossland
  
  The name Crossland was not always known in the Marches. In truth, it's a name
  of convenience, not bloodline—a banner taken up by those who had none. It was
  whispered into being by a collection of strays, traders, and opportunists who
  saw strength in numbers and prosperity in unity.
  
  At the heart stands Marcus Crossland, the first to bear the name. Where he came
  from is a matter of speculation. Some say he was a disgraced farmhand, others
  that he cut his teeth dealing in debts and disputes before setting his sights
  on something greater. What's certain is that he gathered the right sort of
  people—those who had fallen through the cracks of Marcher society but weren't
  ready to be trampled.
  
  ### The Early Years
  
  It started small, as such things do. A few odd jobs, a little trade, a handful
  of favors called in. A deal struck in Hay. A debt settled in Meade. A problem
  quietly resolved in the night. Before long, the Crossland name began to mean
  something.
  
  In the Marches, where land and loyalty hold power, House Crossland offered
  something different—a place for those without either. Not sworn to any one
  household, not reliant on favor, but moving between them, making themselves
  indispensable.
  
  ### Growth and Influence
  
  In recent years, with the Empire looking outward—toward war with the Jotun,
  toward reclaiming Bregasland—House Crossland took root in the Marches. With a
  keen sense for opportunity, they built connections rather than claims, trading
  in information, supplies, and solutions to problems others would rather not
  acknowledge.
  
  They spread their reach across the Marches, but never tied themselves down.
  Their people were seen at market fairs and in military camps, on the road with
  traders, or raising tankards in distant taverns. To some, they were an insult
  to tradition, a group who skirted the rigid order of Marcher life, refusing to
  be bound to one farm, one stead, one banner.
  
  But to others, they were a lifeline.
  
  ### The Yeoman's End
  
  As their influence grew, so did their presence in Anvil. The Yeoman's End
  became their base of operations—a place where deals are made, fortunes won and
  lost, and fates decided over bowls of their now-famous soup. What began as a
  simple gathering spot has become known throughout the Empire as a nexus of
  opportunity and intrigue.
  
  ### Where We Stand Now
  
  House Crossland has grown beyond a handful of vagabonds scraping by on odd
  jobs. Our name carries weight, our presence in the Empire cannot be ignored,
  and when we take interest in a venture, it tends to prosper—or disappear.
  
  We are not noble, not yeoman, not militia, and yet we command respect.
  
  Where we go next is up to us. But one thing is certain—House Crossland is not
  a family easily crossed, nor one to be taken lightly.
