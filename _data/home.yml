  ### The Rise of House Crossland


  The name Crossland was not always known in the Marches. In truth, it's a name
  of convenience, not bloodlineâ€”a banner taken up by those who had none. It was
  whispered into being by a collection of strays, traders, and opportunists who
  saw strength in numbers and prosperity in unity.
